# Peak's Crazy TODO List
This might also have stuff for Pile, MountainOS and MatNet!

1. Add better package support to Pile
	- Make sure loading from .pile folders works ✓
	- Make Pile a package manager
2. Make utils.eventEmitter take the thread into account ✓ UNTESTED
3. Switch to OO-style ✓ NOT VERY TESTED
