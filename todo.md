# Peak's Crazy TODO List
This might also have stuff for Pile, MountainOS and MatNet!

1. Add better package support to Pile
2. Make utils.eventEmitter take the thread into account
3. Add support for waiting for callbacks in threads
4. Make devices work better
	- Use a wrap method (callMethod and listMethods)
	- More info for hardware devices
